We are the ultrafast terahertz (THz) research group at uOttawa.
Our research stands at the crossroad of THz photonics, quantum physics, experimental condensed matter physics, and nonlinear optics. Our projects are inherently interdisciplinary, often conducted in collaboration with leading research groups and industry partners. Our current projects include the real-time THz spectroscopy of phenomena occurring on the µs time scale and the development of a single-THz-photon detector to develop sensitive wireless communication receivers and enable new quantum applications in imaging. We also use THz metasurfaces/metamaterials to enhance highly nonlinear optical effects and explore the intriguing quantum regime of vibrational polaritonics. 

Our group is affiliated with the [Max Planck - uOttawa Centre for Extreme and Quantum Photonics](https://www.uottawa.ca/research-innovation/), the [Joint Centre for Extreme Photonics (JCEP)](https://extremephotonics.com/) and the [Center for Quantum 2D Materials](https://qc2dm.physics.uottawa.ca/) We also benefit from the infrastructure provided by the Centre for Research in Photonics and the Centre for Advanced Materials Research.

**Join us as we push the boundaries of science and technology, striving to unlock new potentials in the fascinating world of THz photonics [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) !**

**Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) Statement**
We form an international research group with people of various background. We believe that everyone has the right to live without fear or prejudice regardless of race, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, social class, religion and belief. We also believe that everyone should be able to make a full contribution to society in their own unique way and live in a world which values respect and diversity.
