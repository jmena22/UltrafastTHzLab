# Open positions

**We are currently open for graduate students and postdocs. We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

MSc and PhD projects are not simply assigned to students; they are collaboratively defined through thoughtful discussions and considerations. Since passion is a strong catalyst for success, each new student is presented with a challenge that they feel motivated and excited to tackle. Projects readily available in our lab involve THz metasurfaces, single-pulse THz spectroscopy and single-THz-photon detection.  **

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a graduate student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:jean-michel.menard@uottawa.ca). State briefly why you are interested to join the group and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates at this point.

We especially welcome anyone with scholarships or fellowships. 
For postdoc applicants, take a look at the [Banting fellowship](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html). Also, I am a Humboldt Fellow and as such, I welcome the application from all German researchers interested to apply for the [Feodor Lynen Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship)

### Honour's projects for uOttawa physics students
If you are a physics or electrical engineering student at uOttawa looking for a Coop or a Honour's project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.
