# Open positions

**We are currently open for PhD and postdoc applications. The positions are mostly related to THz metasurfaces, single-pulse THz spectroscopy and single-THz-photon detection.**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!


### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:jean-michel.menard@uottawa.ca). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [Banting fellowship] (https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html). In many country, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs. For example, as a Humboldt Fellow, I can host German applicants of the [Feodor Lynen Fellowship] (https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship))**

### Master students from elsewhere
Sometimes, we take summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).

### Honour's projects for uOttawa physics students
If you are a physics student at uOttawa looking for a Honour's project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.
