# Open positions

**We have open positions for graduate students and postdocs. We are looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!**

MSc and PhD projects are not simply assigned to students; they are collaboratively defined through thoughtful discussions and considerations. I believe that passion is the catalyst for success, and I aim to present each student with a challenge that they feel motivated and excited to tackle. Projects readily available in our lab involve THz metasurfaces, single-pulse THz spectroscopy and single-THz-photon detection, and there's more.

### Applications for MSc, PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a graduate student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:jean-michel.menard@uottawa.ca). State briefly why you are interested to join the group and attach a CV, including a unofficial transcript or information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates.

We especially welcome applicants with graduate scholarships or postdoc fellowships. 
As a Humboldt Fellow, I am happy to support German postdocs and visiting researchers interested to apply to the Humboldt Foundation to finance part of their research activities in my lab. For example: [Feodor Lynen Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship)
Also, exceptionally strong postdoc applicants should consider applying to the prestigious [Banting fellowship](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html). 

### Projects for uOttawa undergraduate students
If you are a physics or electrical engineering student at uOttawa looking for a Coop internship, a summer research projet or a Honour's project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.
